<h3>What I've learned during this project</h3>
<ol>
  <li>While using only C++ classes to do this project, I've learned a lot about programming, but for the purpose of creating a game, using a mixed of blueprint and C++ classes is way more efficient</li>
  <li>Making multiple build of your game during developement to ensure that everything is working properly once build</li>
  <li>Ensuring the everything is setup properly before starting the developement process</li>
 
</ol>
